        <h3 class="collapsible-title">How long has this clan been around?</h3>
        <div class="collapsible-section--content" style="display: none;">
          <p>BEATS BY CAYDE was founded in the first weeks following the release of Destiny 1. Some of the members have been playing ever since the alpha. The original clan name was Subsidizers, but as the clan grew the Admins decided it was time for a name change so when rise of iron came out the name was officially changed to Luminous avant-gardeians. After the release of curse of osiris alot of our members stopped playing, however with the release of warmind and foresaken alot of them have since returned. The name BEAT BY CAYDE was a result of a clan merger with ghost of saint 14 . THE NAME IS OBVIOUSLY AN HOMAGE TO THE LATE GREAT CAYDE-6</p>
